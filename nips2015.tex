\begin{abstract}
Given a large database of sequential data, a natural problem is to find the entry in the database which is most similar to a query sequence.
Warping-based similarity metrics such as the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance can be prohibitively expensive when the sequences are long and/or high-dimensional.
To mitigate these issues, \cite{raffel2015large} utilizes a convolutional network to map sequences of feature vectors to downsampled sequences of binary vectors.
On the task of matching synthetic renditions of pieces of music to a large database of audio recordings of songs, this approach was able to efficiently discard 99\% of the database with high confidence.
We extend this approach to the multimodal setting where rather than synthetic renditions a matrix representation of the piece's score is used instead, demonstrating that this approach is adaptable to the underlying representation.
